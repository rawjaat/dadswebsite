<p> <a href="../books.htm#buffalo">This collection of persona poems</a> tells
the story of the infamous Lewis &amp; Clark
expedition from the point of view of Clark's personal slave, York. The poems
form a narrative of York's inner and outer journey, before, during and after
the expedition — a journey from slavery to freedom, from the plantation to the
great northwest, from servant to soul yearning to be free.</p>

<p><span class="bottnav"><i>&#8220;I proceeded on the sandy coast and marked my
name on a small pine, the day of the month and year&#8230;&#8221; <br />
&#8211;William
Clark, November 19, 1905 </i></span></p>
<p>If I could make my words dress<br />
they naked selves in blackberry juice<br />
and lay down on a piece a bark, sheep<br />
or onion skin, the way Massa do.<br />
If I could send a story home to my wife<br />
float it in the wind, on wings or water<br />
I&#8217;d tell her about Katonka, the buffalo<br />
and all the big wide and high places<br />
this side a the big river.<br />
How his family, numbering three for every<br />
star in the sky, look like a forest when they<br />
graze together, turn into the muddy Mississippi<br />
when they thunder along, faster than any horse, <br />
making the grass lay down<br />
long after the quiet has returned.<br />
How they lead us through the mountain snow<br />
single file, in drifts up to our necks.<br />
How they don&#8217;t so much as raise a tail<br />
when I come round with my wooly head<br />
and tobacco skin, like I&#8217;m one a them<br />
making the Sioux and Crow think me<br />
&#8220;Big Medicine, Katonka who walk like man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today we stood on the edge of all this<br />
and looked out at so much water, the mountains we crossed <br />
to get here seem a little smaller.</p>
<p>As I watched black fish as big as cabins take to the air<br />
and splash back in the water like children playing<br />
I thought about you, us and if we gone ever be free,<br />
then I close my eyes and pray<br />
that I don&#8217;t live long enough to see<br />
Massa make this ugly too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="bottnav"><i>The expedition left Louisville, Kentucky on October 26,
1803</i></span></p>
<p>When we first left Kentucke<br />
the trees had commenced to dressing up<br />
the fall harvest and the garden pumpkins <br />
was already bigger than my head.</p>
<p>Massa Clark didn&#8217;t ask me to go on no expedition.<br />
He just say &#8220;pack&#8221; and pointed to the door.<br />
So I gather up what little I got and more than I can carry of his<br />
and head off to a sail-bearing keelboat<br />
where his friend Massa Lewis is waiting.<br />
That boat was so big<br />
you could lay any ten of the sixteen men on board<br />
or eight a me head to toe and still have enough <br />
room for the dog.</p>
<p>We start out on the Ohio, swing up the Big Muddy <br />
til we gets to the mouth of the river they call the M&#8217;soura<br />
and set up winter camp a good canoe ride from Saint Louie.<br />
That spring when the rains come we cross the Muddy<br />
and commence to climbing the M&#8217;soura <br />
and float right up thru what seem like heaven on earth;<br />
more sky than I ever seen, rocks as pretty as trees <br />
and game so plentiful they come right down to the river bank<br />
and invites they selves to dinner.</p>
<p>Now, I ain&#8217;t what you would call<br />
a scripture quoter, but the first time<br />
I seen the water fall at M&#8217;soura,<br />
felt a herd of buffalo stampede and looked down from top <br />
a Rock Mountains, it was like church.</p>
<p>Where else but God's house can a body servant<br />
big as me, carry a rifle, hatchet and a bone handle knife <br />
so sharp it can peel the black off a lump a coal<br />
and the white man<br />
still close his eyes and feel safe, at night?</p>
