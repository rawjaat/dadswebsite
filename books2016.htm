<p class="bio">Around the void left by the murder of Medgar Evers in 1963, the poems in this collection speak, unleashing the strong emotions both before and after the moment of assassination. Poems take on the voices of Evers's widow, Myrlie; his brother, Charles; his assassin, Byron De La Beckwith; and each of De La Beckwith's two wives. Except for the book's title,"Turn me loose," which were his final words, Evers remains in this collection silent. Yet the poems accumulate facets of the love and hate with which others saw this man, unghosting him in a way that only imagination makes possible.<br />

<p class="bio">In this new collection of poems, Frank X Walker immerses himself in the story of legendary African American
  jockey Isaac Burns Murphy (1861-1896). The son of a slave, Murphy rose to the top of thoroughbred racing 
  to become the most successful Jockey in America. Through poetic imagination, Walker gives us the voices of Isaac Murphy and his wife Lucy, his trainer Eli Jordan, and his parents James and America Burns. Through their words we follow Murphy's dramatic Journey to become America's most celebrated black jockey.<br />

</i>(University Press of Kentucky, 2008)<br />
ISBN 978-0-8131-9184-3 • $15.00</p>
<p>A sequel to the award-winning <i>Buffalo Dance</i>, Frank X Walker's <i>When
Winter Come: The Ascension of York</i> is a dramatic reimagining of Lewis and
Clark's legendary exploration of the American West. Grounded in the history of
the famous trip, Walker's vibrant account allows York — little more than a forgotten
footnote in traditional narratives — to embody the full range of human ability,
knowledge, emotion, and experience. Knowledge of the seasons unfolds to York &quot;like
a book,&quot; and he &quot;can read moss, sunsets, the moon, and a mare's foaling
time with a touch.&quot;</p>
<p>During the journey, York forges a spiritual connection and shares sensual
delights with a Nez Perce woman, and Walker's poems capture the profound feelings
of love and loss on each side of this ill-fated meeting of souls. As the perspectives
of Lewis, Clark, Sacagawea, and others in the party emerge, Walker also gives
voice to York's knife, his hunting shirt, and the river waters that have borne
thousands of travelers before and after the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>
<p>The alternately heartbreaking and uplifting poems in <i>When
Winter Come</i> are
told from multiple perspectives and rendered in vivid detail. <i>When
Winter Come</i> exalts the historical persona of a slave and lifts the soul of a man; York ascends
out of his chains, out of oblivion, and into flight. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;Frank X Walker has re-imagined the story of the Lewis
and Clark expedition in a way no one else has before. This powerful and insightful
book is more than an admirable sequel to Buffalo Dance. It is a careful re-examination
of historical records, re-imagined and conjured into a concert of voices whose
aim is truth. One can read When Winter Come through from beginning to end like
a good novel, and then go back and savor it one poem at time. Walker has given
all of us who care about American Literature a lasting gift.&quot; —Greg Pape,
Montana Poet Laureate (2007-2009) and author of <i>Sunflower
Facing the Sun</i> and
<i>Border Crossings</i></p>
<p class="bio">&quot;<i>When Winter Come</i> is an astonishing collection of
poems that ushers Frank X Walker into the company of other memorable poets like
Roethke, Hugo, Clifton, and Dove but he also recollects the powerful narrative
voice of Michael Ondaatje's Coming <i>Through Slaughter</i> or Alice Walker's <i>The
Color Purple</i>.
Frank X Walker magically captures York, not the flat historical figure represented
in Lewis &amp; Clark's journals — Walker has tapped into the true voice of York
and conjured him on the page. This is not just a book of poems — this is a book
of spirits and shimmering apparitions.&quot; — Debra Magpie Earling, author of
<i>Perma Red</i></p>

<p> The degree to which university professors have staked their academic lives
and intellectual selves on every accented syllable of dead white men, having
diagramed their “brilliant” intentions and held it up as evidence that poetry
is the caviar on the literary menu, has helped carve out an elitist mystique
and ruined many a promising young poet. In the pages that follow, we offer a
counter argument: that poetry is bread. That it is whole grain sustenance and
comes in all colors, ethnicities, sizes, genders, and sexual preferences. It
is not just the leather-bound private joy of scholars, but new and naked and
pouring out of the stomachs and hearts of emerging and established writers all
over this country. </p>
<p>America needs poetry more than it needs prisons; ill-conceived government
policies, inadequate schools, political spin, or exit polls. Poetry, when used
correctly, is the most democratic thing we own. It belongs to the people. It
is for the people and it rings truest when written by the people. </p>
<p>You probably won’t find these poets in your syllabus, though there are more
prize-winning writers in these pages than you will find in many university English
departments. But wherever you can find a table or a hungry mouth; wherever people
need nothing else with their soup but homemade biscuits, cornbread, tortillas,
challah, or frybread, fresh out of the oven, I hope you will find this book being
read aloud or passed hand to hand with love, with appreciation for genuine solutions
for real hunger. </p>
<p>America is hungry for truth and it’s being served right here, right now. </p>

(University Press of Kentucky,
2003) <br />
ISBN 0-8131-9088-6 • $15.00</p>
<p>This collection of persona poems tells the story of the infamous Lewis &amp; Clark
expedition from the point of view of Clark's personal slave, York. The poems
form a narrative of York's inner and outer journey, before, during and after
the expedition — a journey from slavery to freedom, from the plantation to the
great northwest, from servant to soul yearning to be free.</p>
<p>Over the course of the saga and through the poems, we are treated to subtle
and overt commentaries on literacy, slavery, native Americans, buffalo, the environment,
and more. Though Buffalo Dance purposely references historic accounts and facts,
it is fictionalized poetry, and Frank X Walker's rare blend of history and art
breathes life into an important but overlooked historical figure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;And now York, finally, has a voice. The man who made
the voyage, the man with all the hopes and dreams of freedom has a voice, raises
a song to his freedom, understands that his life was not his best self, only
the best he could do. Let us all raise a praise song to Frank X Walker, for giivng
voice to York. What a magnificent achievement.&quot; &#8212;Nikki Giovanni</p>
<p class="bio">&quot;<i>Buffalo Dance</i> has great power and beauty. This is poetry and
storytelling of high order.&quot; &#8212;Gurney Norman</p>
