<h2>On Frank </h2>
<p class="bio">&quot;The work of Frank X Walker is an eclectic, powerful mixture
of liberating style, profound insight, and unwavering organic connection to the
intellectual, political, and cultural struggles of a people. He stands in the
tradition of DuBois, McKay, Robeson, Hughes, and other great writers, poets and
performers whose contributions have transcended time and space to give generation
after generation pause and hope.&quot; — Ricky L. Jones, author of <i>Black Haze</i> </p>
<h2>On <i>Buffalo Dance: the Journey of York</i> </h2>
<p>&quot;An ardently imagined and gloriously vivid first-person account
of York’s awe over the munificent and daunting wilderness, and instant rapport
with the Indians he meets.”— <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p>
<p class="bio">“A brave collection of poems. . . . Brims with the rich complexity
of York’s condition in a way that will appeal to a wide audience.”— Louisville
<i>Courier-Journal</i></p>
