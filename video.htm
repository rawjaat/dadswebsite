<h1>Coal Black Voices: a documentary </h1>
<p><a href="http://coalblackvoices.com/documentary/"><b>Coal Black Voices</b></a> is an intimate mosaic of images, poetry, and storytelling
by the <a href="http://www.mwg.org/production/documentary/voices/poets/index.html">Affrilachian
Poets</a> as they give glimpses of life in the American Black
South and Appalachian region. The ensemble of African-American writers challenge
simple notions of an all white Appalachian region and culture while drawing on
traditions such as the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, and experiences
of the African Diaspora. The poetry of the Affrilachian Poets celebrates their
African heritage and rural roots while encompassing themes of racism and Black
identity. In this documentary they give voice to the pleasures of family, land,
good food, artistic community, music and transformation.</p>
