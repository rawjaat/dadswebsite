<p class="bio">In this new collection of poems, Frank X Walker immerses himself in the story of legendary African American
  jockey Isaac Burns Murphy (1861-1896). The son of a slave, Murphy rose to the top of thoroughbred racing 
  to become the most successful Jockey in America. Through poetic imagination, Walker gives us the voices of Isaac Murphy and his wife Lucy, his trainer Eli Jordan, and his parents James and America Burns. Through their words we follow Murphy's dramatic Journey to become America's most celebrated black jockey.<br />

    <p>A sequel to the award-winning <em>Buffalo Dance</em>, Frank X Walker's <em>When Winter Come: The Ascension of York</em> is a dramatic reimagining of Lewis and Clark's legendary exploration of the American West. Grounded in the history of the famous trip, Walker's vibrant account allows York — little more than a forgotten footnote in traditional narratives — to embody the full range of human ability, knowledge, emotion, and experience. Knowledge of the seasons unfolds to York &quot;like a book,&quot; and he &quot;can read moss, sunsets, the moon, and a mare's foaling time with a touch.&quot;</p>

      <i>America! What's My Name? The &quot;Other&quot; Poets
      Unfurl the Flag</i> (Frank X Walker, ed.) </h1>
<p class="bio"> The degree to which university professors have staked their academic lives
  and intellectual selves on every accented syllable of dead white men, having
  diagramed their “brilliant” intentions and held it up as evidence that poetry
  is the caviar on the literary menu, has helped carve out an elitist mystique
  and ruined many a promising young poet. In the pages that follow, we offer a
  counter argument: that poetry is bread. That it is whole grain sustenance and
  comes in all colors, ethnicities, sizes, genders, and sexual preferences. It
  is not just the leather-bound private joy of scholars, but new and naked and
  pouring out of the stomachs and hearts of emerging and established writers all
  over this country. <a href="books.htm#america">Read more about <i>America! What's My Name?</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1893239632/103-2048413-7776638?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=windpublica0b-20">order

<p class="bio">Poet Frank X Walker believes artists aren't
the only creative people. He says barbers, cooks, janitors and kids enrich the
world with their creativity as much as the painters, sculptors and writers. [<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5298083">Read
