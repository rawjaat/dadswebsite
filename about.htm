<h2>Artist Statement </h2>
<p><b>I have accepted the responsibility</b> of challenging the notion of a homogeneous
all-white literary landscape in this region.</p>
<p><b>As a co-founder of the Affrilachian Poets and the creator
of the word <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/Affrilachian.asp">Affrilachia</a></b>,
I believe it is my responsibility to say as loudly and often as possible that
people and artists of color are part of the past and present of the multi-state
Appalachian region extending from northern Mississippi to southern New York.</p>
<p><b>As a writer/observer/truth teller,</b> I choose to focus on social justice
issues as well as multiple themes of family, identity and place.</p>
<p class="bio"><b>I also accept the dual responsibility</b> of existing as a teaching artist and
making a commitment to the identification and development of the next generation
of young writers and artists. </p>
